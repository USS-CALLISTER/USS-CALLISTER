I sit in the danganronpa area, if we are not already close please try not to interact with me much since I am iffy with half of that area, even if you aren't involved in anything please just leave me be, even if you are friends with my partner, just be careful. Thank you.

- They/Them/Any pronouns that arent "She" or "Neo/Xenos".
- AroAce, Cassmasculine, Nonbinary, MLM/NBLM are labels that I use, do not refer to me as strictly female or male, mix it up. or just make it easy and use they/them.
- AUDD (ADD + AUTISM) , BPD , Dyslexia. These are ones I'd rather you be aware of.
